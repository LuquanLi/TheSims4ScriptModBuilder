## What is this tutorial for?

The Sims4 script mod is a type of mod that allows creators to access and modify the game data by python script directly. For example, in the EA official cheat instruction, we can enter motherlode in the cheat console to get 50k simoleons. A script mod could achieve this with the following process: find what is the simoleons for the current sim, add 50k, then update it.
One of the most popular script mods for The Sims4 is MC Command Center, with this module, you could expand the functionality and story progression within the game.

I am a The Sims player, and also a software engineer. After using the MC Command Center for years, I would like to start writing some script mods myself. However, MCCC is not an open-source project, gladly, I am able to find some other Sims4 mod projects on Github. This tutorial is a basic version of the existing projects, a beginner guide, that helps new creators to build their ideal world within The Sims.
